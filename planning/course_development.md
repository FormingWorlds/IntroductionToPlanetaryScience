### Reusable Material from course2025

The previous iteration (12 lectures, 9 tutorials) provides a foundation to draw from. Key assets:

- **Tutorial problems:** Many problems from tutorials 1–9 can be adapted for the new homework sheets, particularly:
  - Tutorial 1 (Dynamics): Jupyter notebooks on resonances and N-body → Homework 1
  - Tutorial 2 (Heat): Analytical problems → Homework 2
  - Tutorial 3 (Atmospheres): Analytical problems → Homework 3
  - Tutorial 4 (Surfaces & interiors): Can be split across Homeworks 4 and 5
  - Tutorial 5 (Magnetospheres): Problems → fold into Homework 2
  - Tutorials 7–8 (Minor planets, comets): Combine → Homework 6
  - Tutorial 9 (Planet formation): Fold into Homework 1

- **Exam questions:** Previous mid-term and final exams provide a question bank to draw from and adapt.

- **Lecture slides:** Previous lecture content provides reference material, though all notes will be rewritten as custom lecture notes rather than slide decks.

### Development Sequence

1. **Phase 1 — Lecture notes (Lectures 1–8):** Core foundational content, needed first since all other lectures build on these.
2. **Phase 2 — Homework sheets 1–4 + mid-term exam:** Homework covering Lectures 1–8 and mid-term covering Lectures 1–7, developed in parallel with Phase 1.
3. **Phase 3 — Lecture notes (Lectures 9–14):** Planet-specific, exoplanets, and synthesis lectures.
4. **Phase 4 — Homework sheets 5–7 + final exam:** Remaining homework and cumulative final exam.
5. **Phase 5 — Review and polish:** Cross-referencing between lectures, consistency check, equation sheet compilation.
