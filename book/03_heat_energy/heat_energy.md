# Lecture 3: Planetary Heat & Energy Transport

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to identify the main energy sources driving planetary evolution, distinguish between heat transport mechanisms, and apply scaling laws for convection and thermal evolution.
