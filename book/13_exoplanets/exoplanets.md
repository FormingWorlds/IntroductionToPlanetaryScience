# Lecture 13: Exoplanets — Detection Methods, Demographics, & Characterization

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to explain the main exoplanet detection methods and their biases, describe the observed demographics of exoplanet populations, and discuss atmospheric characterisation techniques including JWST results.
```

## Historical context

First detections: pulsar planets and 51 Peg b.

## Transit method

Light curves, radius determination, and Kepler/TESS missions.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Direct imaging

Coronagraphy, high-contrast techniques, and current capabilities.
