## A pale blue dot

On 14 February 1990, the Voyager 1 spacecraft turned its camera back toward the inner solar system one last time. From a distance of 6 billion km — about 40 AU — it captured an image in which Earth appears as a tiny speck, less than a single pixel, suspended in a scattered beam of sunlight. Carl Sagan, who had campaigned for years to have the photograph taken, wrote: *"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us"* {cite}`Sagan1994`. Minutes later, Voyager's cameras were switched off for good.

That image captures something essential about planetary science: it asks us to see our own world not as the centre of the universe, but as one planet among many — a physical system that can be studied, compared, and understood. This course is built around three questions that drive that effort:

1. **How did our solar system form, and is it typical?** Before 1992, we knew of exactly zero planets outside our solar system. Today we have confirmed over 5,700 exoplanets in more than 4,300 systems. Statistical analyses of the Kepler survey suggest that roughly 0.4–0.6 rocky, habitable-zone planets exist per Sun-like star {cite}`Bryson2021` — implying hundreds of millions of such worlds in the Milky Way alone. Yet we have detailed knowledge of only one planetary system.

2. **What determines whether a planet becomes habitable?** Venus, Earth, and Mars all formed from the same protoplanetary disk, likely with similar initial compositions. All three may have had early liquid water. Yet today Venus has a 460 °C surface beneath 90 bar of CO$_2$, Earth has oceans and a biosphere, and Mars is a cold desert with an atmosphere thinner than 1% of Earth's. Understanding why they diverged is one of the central puzzles of planetary science.

3. **Are we alone?** JWST is currently attempting to detect and characterise atmospheres on rocky exoplanets, including the TRAPPIST-1 system. Within your careers, this question may become answerable — but only if we understand what makes a planet habitable in the first place.

Every topic in this course — from orbital dynamics and interior structure to atmospheric physics and surface geology — connects back to these three questions. By the end, you will have the tools to think about them quantitatively.

## What is a planet?

The word "planet" derives from the Greek *planetes* (πλανήτης), meaning "wanderer." To ancient observers, the planets were the five visible points of light — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn — that moved against the fixed background of stars. Together with the Sun and Moon, these seven wanderers gave us the seven days of the week.

For over two millennia, the list of planets seemed settled. That changed with the invention of the telescope. William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781 — the first planet found in modern times. In 1846, Johann Galle observed Neptune at a position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier from perturbations in Uranus's orbit, a triumph of Newtonian mechanics. And in 1930, Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto at Lowell Observatory after a painstaking photographic search.

But Pluto was always an oddity: small, icy, with an eccentric and inclined orbit that crosses Neptune's. When astronomers began discovering other large objects in the Kuiper Belt in the 1990s and 2000s — culminating in the discovery of Eris in 2005 by Brown, Trujillo, and Rabinowitz, which appeared comparable in size to Pluto — the question became unavoidable: either these new objects were also planets, or Pluto was not.

### The IAU definition

On 24 August 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted Resolution B5, establishing three criteria for a body in the solar system to be classified as a **planet** {cite}`IAU2006`:

1. It is in orbit around the Sun.
2. It has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces, so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape.
3. It has **cleared the neighbourhood** around its orbit.

A body satisfying criteria 1 and 2 but not 3 is a **dwarf planet**. Under this definition, the solar system has eight planets and five officially recognised dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Makemake, and Haumea. Many additional candidates exist in the Kuiper Belt.

The definition remains debated. Critics note that "clearing the neighbourhood" is not precisely defined and depends on heliocentric distance — Earth would not clear its zone if placed at Neptune's orbit. An alternative **geophysical definition** proposes that any body massive enough to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium should count as a planet, regardless of its orbital dynamics {cite}`Runyon2017`. Under this broader definition, the solar system would have well over 100 planets.

For this course, the exact classification matters less than the physics. The important point is that the solar system contains a continuous spectrum of objects — from dust grains to gas giants — governed by the same physical laws.

## Brief history of planetary science

Planetary science as a discipline is remarkably young, but its roots reach back to the earliest recorded observations.

### Ancient and pre-telescopic astronomy

Babylonian astronomers systematically tracked planetary positions as early as 1800 BCE, developing arithmetical methods to predict conjunctions and oppositions. Greek natural philosophers constructed geometric models: Aristotle's geocentric spheres (~350 BCE) and Ptolemy's epicyclic system (~150 CE) remained the standard framework for over a millennium.

The Copernican revolution began in 1543, when Nicolaus Copernicus published *De revolutionibus*, placing the Sun at the centre. Johannes Kepler refined this model into his three empirical laws of planetary motion (1609–1619), replacing circles with ellipses. Isaac Newton's *Principia* (1687) showed that all three of Kepler's laws follow from a single universal law of gravitation — the first grand unification in physics.

### The telescopic era

Galileo Galilei's telescope observations in 1610 transformed planetary science from mathematics into a physical science. He discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter (now called the Galilean moons), observed the phases of Venus (confirming it orbits the Sun), and resolved Saturn's rings (though he could not interpret their structure). Over the following centuries, improving telescopes revealed surface features on Mars, the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, and the detailed ring structure of Saturn.

The 19th century brought spectroscopy, allowing astronomers to determine atmospheric compositions remotely for the first time. Photography enabled systematic surveys, and the discoveries of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto progressively expanded the known solar system.

### The space age

The modern era of planetary science began on 14 December 1962, when NASA's Mariner 2 flew past Venus — the first spacecraft to successfully visit another planet. This flyby revealed Venus's extreme surface temperature, overturning earlier speculation about habitable conditions beneath its clouds.

The pace of exploration accelerated rapidly. Mariner 4 returned the first close-up images of Mars in 1965, revealing a cratered, apparently dead world — not the canal-laced surface some had imagined. The Soviet Venera 7 achieved the first landing on another planet (Venus, 1970). NASA's Viking landers (1976) conducted the first experiments searching for life on Mars. The twin Voyager spacecraft (launched 1977) exploited a rare planetary alignment to conduct a grand tour of the outer solar system, visiting Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune between 1979 and 1989.

### The exoplanet revolution

In 1992, Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of planets orbiting a pulsar — the first confirmed exoplanets {cite}`Wolszczan1992`. Three years later, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz detected 51 Pegasi b, the first planet orbiting a Sun-like star — a "hot Jupiter" with a 4.2-day orbit that challenged all existing formation theories {cite}`MayorQueloz1995`. NASA's Kepler mission (2009–2018) discovered thousands of transiting exoplanets, while the ongoing TESS mission (launched 2018) surveys the brightest nearby stars. JWST, launched in December 2021, is now characterising exoplanet atmospheres through transmission and emission spectroscopy ({ref}`lecture13`).

Today, planetary science integrates astronomy, physics, chemistry, geology, and atmospheric science. It spans scales from dust grains in protoplanetary disks to the demographics of planetary systems across the Galaxy.

## Overview of the solar system

### Architecture and scale

The solar system extends from the Sun (radius $\Rsun = 6.96 \times 10^8$ m) to the Oort Cloud, a hypothetical reservoir of comets at roughly $10^4$–$10^5$ AU. Its principal components, from the inside out, are:

- **The inner solar system:** Four rocky (terrestrial) planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars — with semi-major axes between 0.39 and 1.52 AU. These are small, dense, and composed primarily of rock and metal.
- **The asteroid belt:** A population of rocky and metallic bodies between roughly 2.1 and 3.3 AU, dominated by the dwarf planet Ceres (diameter ~940 km). The total mass of the asteroid belt is only ~$4 \times 10^{-4}$ $\Mearth$.
- **The outer solar system:** Four giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn (gas giants), Uranus, Neptune (ice giants) — between 5.2 and 30.1 AU. These are massive, with thick hydrogen–helium envelopes and extensive moon systems.
- **The Kuiper Belt:** A disk of icy bodies beyond Neptune (~30–50 AU), including the dwarf planets Pluto, Eris, and Makemake. The scattered disk extends to greater distances with more eccentric orbits.
- **The Oort Cloud:** A spherical shell of icy bodies at $10^4$–$10^5$ AU, believed to be the source of long-period comets. Its existence is inferred from cometary orbits but has not been directly observed.

### Planetary properties

The table below summarises the key physical and orbital properties of the eight planets. Note the enormous dynamic range: Jupiter is over 5,700 times more massive than Mercury, yet both orbit the same star.

**Key properties of the eight solar system planets.** Data from the NASA Planetary Fact Sheet {cite}`NASAFactSheet`.

| Planet | Mass ($\Mearth$) | Radius ($\Rearth$) | $a$ (AU) | $P$ (yr) | $e$ | $\rho$ (kg m$^{-3}$) |
|--------|------:|--------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Mercury | 0.055 | 0.383 | 0.387 | 0.241 | 0.206 | 5427 |
| Venus | 0.815 | 0.949 | 0.723 | 0.615 | 0.007 | 5243 |
| Earth | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.017 | 5514 |
| Mars | 0.107 | 0.532 | 1.524 | 1.881 | 0.093 | 3934 |
| Jupiter | 317.8 | 11.21 | 5.203 | 11.86 | 0.049 | 1326 |
| Saturn | 95.16 | 9.45 | 9.537 | 29.46 | 0.054 | 687 |
| Uranus | 14.54 | 4.01 | 19.19 | 84.01 | 0.047 | 1271 |
| Neptune | 17.15 | 3.88 | 30.07 | 164.8 | 0.009 | 1638 |

Two patterns stand out immediately. First, **density decreases with distance**: the inner planets have $\rho > 3900$ kg m$^{-3}$ (rock and metal), while the outer planets have $\rho < 1700$ kg m$^{-3}$ (gas and ice). Saturn is famously less dense than water. This gradient reflects the temperature structure of the protoplanetary disk from which the planets formed ({ref}`lecture02`). Second, **mass is concentrated in Jupiter**: it contains more than twice the mass of all other planets combined. We will quantify this in the blackboard derivation below.

### Classification

Planets are broadly classified by composition and structure:

- **Terrestrial planets** (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars): Rocky surfaces, iron cores, thin or no atmospheres (Venus being the exception with its massive CO$_2$ atmosphere). Covered in {ref}`lecture09` and {ref}`lecture10`.
- **Gas giants** (Jupiter, Saturn): Massive hydrogen–helium envelopes with no well-defined solid surface, likely rocky/icy cores at high pressure. Covered in {ref}`lecture11`.
- **Ice giants** (Uranus, Neptune): Smaller than gas giants, with interiors dominated by heavier volatiles (H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CH$_4$) under extreme pressures, topped by hydrogen–helium atmospheres. Also covered in {ref}`lecture11`.

## Comparative planetology as a methodology

Understanding a single planet in isolation is difficult — we cannot perform controlled experiments on entire worlds. **Comparative planetology** addresses this by treating the planets as a natural set of experiments: similar objects subjected to different conditions.

Consider the terrestrial planets. Venus, Earth, and Mars have broadly similar compositions and formed in the same protoplanetary disk, yet their surfaces and atmospheres are radically different:

| Property | Venus | Earth | Mars |
|----------|-------|-------|------|
| Surface temperature | 460 °C | 15 °C | $-60$ °C |
| Surface pressure | 90 bar | 1 bar | 0.006 bar |
| Dominant atmosphere | CO$_2$ (96.5%) | N$_2$/O$_2$ (99%) | CO$_2$ (95%) |
| Magnetic field | None | Strong dipole | Remnant crustal |
| Tectonics | Episodic resurfacing | Plate tectonics | Stagnant lid |

By comparing these three cases, we can isolate which differences arise from distance to the Sun, planetary mass, internal activity, or historical contingency. The same logic applies to moons: comparing Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — all orbiting Jupiter but differing in composition and tidal heating — reveals how a single variable can drive vastly different geological outcomes.

This comparative approach now extends to thousands of exoplanets, where we can study how planetary properties vary as a function of stellar type, orbital distance, and system architecture ({ref}`lecture13`). It is one of the most powerful tools in modern planetary science, and we will apply it throughout this course.

## Observational techniques

Planetary science draws on a wide range of observational methods, from ground-based telescopes to robotic landers.

### Telescopes

Ground-based telescopes observe planets across the electromagnetic spectrum. Optical imaging resolves surface and atmospheric features, infrared spectroscopy probes thermal emission and atmospheric composition, and radio observations measure subsurface properties and atmospheric dynamics. Adaptive optics on large telescopes (e.g., VLT, Keck) achieve angular resolutions approaching those of space telescopes.

Space-based observatories avoid atmospheric absorption and distortion. The Hubble Space Telescope has monitored atmospheric changes on the giant planets for decades. JWST, operating at infrared wavelengths from the Sun–Earth L2 point, is now the primary tool for exoplanet atmospheric characterisation.

### Spacecraft exploration

Spacecraft provide the most detailed planetary data. Mission types include, in order of increasing complexity and cost:

- **Flyby:** The spacecraft passes a target once, collecting data during a brief encounter. Example: Voyager 2 at Neptune (1989).
- **Orbiter:** The spacecraft enters orbit, enabling long-term monitoring. Example: Cassini at Saturn (2004–2017).
- **Lander:** The spacecraft lands on the surface and measures conditions in situ. Example: Viking 1 on Mars (1976).
- **Rover:** A mobile lander that traverses the surface. Example: Perseverance on Mars (2021–present).
- **Sample return:** Material is collected and returned to Earth for laboratory analysis. Example: Hayabusa2 returned samples from asteroid Ryugu (2020).

### Remote sensing methods

Key remote sensing techniques used across these platforms include:

- **Spectroscopy:** Identifies materials by their characteristic absorption and emission features. Reveals atmospheric composition, surface mineralogy, and thermal properties.
- **Radar:** Penetrates clouds and maps surface topography (e.g., Magellan at Venus) and detects subsurface features (e.g., MARSIS on Mars).
- **Gravimetry:** Maps the gravity field from spacecraft orbital perturbations, revealing interior density variations and subsurface mass concentrations.
- **Magnetometry:** Measures magnetic fields, constraining dynamo activity and interior conductivity.

## Blackboard derivation: Solar mass from planetary orbits

```{admonition} Blackboard derivation (~10 min)
:class: tip

**Goal:** Use Kepler's third law to estimate the mass of the Sun from Earth's orbital parameters, then evaluate the planet-to-star mass ratio for the solar system.
```

### Setup

Consider a planet of mass $M_p$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a star of mass $M_*$. The gravitational force provides the centripetal acceleration:

$$
\frac{G M_* M_p}{r^2} = \frac{M_p v^2}{r}
$$

where $v = 2\pi r / P$ is the orbital velocity and $P$ is the orbital period.

### Derivation

Substituting $v = 2\pi r / P$ and cancelling $M_p$:

$$
\frac{G M_*}{r^2} = \frac{4\pi^2 r}{P^2}
$$

Solving for the stellar mass:

$$
\boxed{M_* = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G P^2}}
$$ (eq:kepler-mass)

This is Newton's form of Kepler's third law (for $M_p \ll M_*$). The planet's mass cancels — the orbital period depends only on the central mass and the orbital radius.

```{note}
For elliptical orbits, the same relation holds with $r$ replaced by the semi-major axis $a$. The derivation of the general case requires the vis-viva equation, which we will cover in {ref}`lecture02`.
```

### Application

Using Earth's orbital parameters:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Semi-major axis $a_\oplus$ | $1.496 \times 10^{11}$ m |
| Orbital period $P_\oplus$ | $3.156 \times 10^7$ s |
| Gravitational constant $G$ | $6.674 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$ kg$^{-1}$ s$^{-2}$ |

$$
\Msun = \frac{4\pi^2 \times (1.496 \times 10^{11})^3}{6.674 \times 10^{-11} \times (3.156 \times 10^7)^2} \approx 1.99 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}
$$

This agrees with the accepted value $\Msun = 1.989 \times 10^{30}$ kg — a remarkably accurate estimate from just two measurable quantities.

### The planet-to-star mass ratio

The more precise form of Kepler's third law is $P^2 = 4\pi^2 a^3 / [G(M_* + M_p)]$, which gives $M_* + M_p$ rather than $M_*$ alone. The approximation $M_* + M_p \approx M_*$ is justified because the planet-to-star mass ratio is tiny:

- Jupiter, the most massive planet: $\Mjup \approx 318 \, \Mearth \approx 1.90 \times 10^{27}$ kg, giving $\Mjup / \Msun \approx 9.5 \times 10^{-4}$.
- Total mass of all eight planets: $\approx 446 \, \Mearth \approx 2.7 \times 10^{27}$ kg, giving $M_\mathrm{planets}/\Msun \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-3}$.

The Sun contains **99.87%** of the solar system's total mass. Jupiter alone accounts for 71% of the planetary mass. This extreme concentration of mass in the central star is a fundamental property of planetary systems — and one that planet formation theory must explain ({ref}`lecture02`).
