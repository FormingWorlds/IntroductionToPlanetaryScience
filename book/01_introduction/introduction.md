```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to describe the scope of planetary science, explain how the field has evolved from antiquity to the space age, and identify the key properties and classification of solar system bodies.

## A pale blue dot

On 14 February 1990, the Voyager 1 spacecraft turned its camera back toward the inner solar system one last time. From a distance of 6 billion km — about 40 AU — it captured an image in which Earth appears as a tiny speck, less than a single pixel, suspended in a scattered beam of sunlight. Carl Sagan, who had campaigned for years to have the photograph taken, wrote: *"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us"* {cite}`Sagan1994`. Minutes later, Voyager's cameras were switched off for good.

That image captures something essential about planetary science: it asks us to see our own world not as the centre of the universe, but as one planet among many — a physical system that can be studied, compared, and understood. This course is built around three questions that drive that effort:

1. **How did our solar system form, and is it typical?** Before 1992, we knew of exactly zero planets outside our solar system. Today we have confirmed over 5,700 exoplanets in more than 4,300 systems. Statistical analyses of the Kepler survey suggest that roughly 0.4–0.6 rocky, habitable-zone planets exist per Sun-like star {cite}`Bryson2021` — implying hundreds of millions of such worlds in the Milky Way alone. Yet we have detailed knowledge of only one planetary system.

2. **What determines whether a planet becomes habitable?** Venus, Earth, and Mars all formed from the same protoplanetary disk, likely with similar initial compositions. All three may have had early liquid water. Yet today Venus has a 460 $\degree$C surface beneath 90 bar of $\ce{CO2}$, Earth has oceans and a biosphere, and Mars is a cold desert with an atmosphere thinner than 1% of Earth's. Understanding why they diverged is one of the central puzzles of planetary science.

3. **Are we alone?** JWST is currently attempting to detect and characterise atmospheres on rocky exoplanets, including the TRAPPIST-1 system. Within your careers, this question may become answerable — but only if we understand what makes a planet habitable in the first place.

Every topic in this course — from orbital dynamics and interior structure to atmospheric physics and surface geology — connects back to these three questions. By the end, you will have the tools to think about them quantitatively.
