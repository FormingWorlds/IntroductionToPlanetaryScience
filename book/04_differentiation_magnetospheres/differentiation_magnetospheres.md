# Lecture 4: Chemical Differentiation & Magnetospheres

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to explain the processes of core formation and mantle differentiation, describe the requirements for planetary dynamo action, and compare magnetic field properties across the solar system.
