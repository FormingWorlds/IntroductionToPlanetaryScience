## Probing interiors

The surface of a planet reveals only the outermost skin of a body that extends thousands of kilometres inward. Understanding what lies beneath — the density structure, composition, phase state, and dynamics — is essential for explaining everything from magnetic fields ({ref}`lecture04`) to volcanic activity ({ref}`lecture07`) to long-term thermal evolution ({ref}`lecture03`). Yet we cannot directly sample a planet's deep interior. Instead, we rely on three complementary observational tools {cite:p}`dePaterLissauer2010`.

**Seismology** is the most powerful probe of interior structure. When seismic waves generated by earthquakes (or marsquakes) travel through a planetary body, they refract and reflect at boundaries between layers of different density and composition. **P-waves** (primary, compressional) travel through both solids and liquids, while **S-waves** (secondary, shear) propagate only through solids. The discovery that S-waves are absent in Earth's outer core — creating a **shadow zone** between angular distances of roughly 104° and 140° from an earthquake's epicentre — provided the definitive evidence that the outer core is liquid {cite:p}`Dziewonski1981`. The travel times, amplitudes, and frequency content of seismic waves recorded at a network of stations can be inverted to determine the radial profiles of density $\rho(r)$, compressional wave speed $v_P(r)$, and shear wave speed $v_S(r)$ throughout the interior.

Paths of seismic P-waves through Earth's interior. P-waves refract as they pass through layers of increasing density, and are blocked by the liquid outer core, creating a **P-wave shadow zone** between approximately 104° and 140° from the earthquake source. S-waves (not shown) are entirely absorbed by the liquid core, producing an even larger shadow zone beyond 104°. These observations provided the definitive evidence for Earth's liquid outer core.

**Gravity field measurements** constrain the distribution of mass within a planet. A perfectly spherical, homogeneous body produces a purely $1/r^2$ gravitational field. Real planets are oblate due to rotation, producing a measurable **gravitational quadrupole moment** $J_2$. The value of $J_2$ depends on how mass is distributed between the equator and the poles, which in turn depends on the density profile. Higher-order gravity harmonics reveal lateral density variations. Spacecraft in orbit (e.g., GRAIL at the Moon, Juno at Jupiter) measure gravity fields with extraordinary precision by tracking tiny Doppler shifts in their radio signals.

**The moment of inertia** is perhaps the single most diagnostic quantity for constraining a planet's internal mass distribution. For a body of mass $M$ and radius $R$, the dimensionless **moment of inertia factor** $C/MR^2$ (where $C$ is the polar moment of inertia) ranges from $2/5 = 0.4$ for a uniform-density sphere to lower values for bodies with mass concentrated toward the centre. A measured value immediately tells us the degree of differentiation:

| Body | $C/MR^2$ | Interpretation |
|------|:---------:|:--------------:|
| Uniform sphere | 0.400 | Homogeneous, undifferentiated |
| Moon | 0.393 | Weakly differentiated, small core |
| Mars | 0.364 | Moderately differentiated |
| Mercury | 0.346 | Large dense core |
| Earth | 0.331 | Strongly differentiated, iron core |

The moment of inertia factor is determined observationally from two quantities: the gravitational oblateness $J_2$ (from spacecraft tracking) and the precession rate of the spin axis (or, equivalently, the forced libration amplitude for bodies in spin–orbit resonance). These are combined using the **Darwin–Radau relation**, which relates $C/MR^2$ to $J_2$ and the rotational flattening.


## Blackboard derivation: Moment of inertia factor

```{admonition} Blackboard derivation: $C/MR^2$ for uniform and differentiated bodies
:class: tip

**Goal:** Derive the moment of inertia factor for (a) a uniform sphere and (b) a two-layer differentiated body, and show how the measured value constrains internal structure.

**Step 1: Moment of inertia of a spherically symmetric body.**

The moment of inertia about the rotation axis is $C = \int r_\perp^2 \, dm$, where $r_\perp$ is the perpendicular distance from the axis. For a thin spherical shell of radius $r$ and density $\rho(r)$, the moment of inertia about a diameter is $dC = \frac{2}{3}r^2 \, dm$, where $dm = 4\pi r^2 \rho(r) \, dr$. Integrating over all shells:

$$
C = \frac{8\pi}{3} \int_0^R \rho(r) \, r^4 \, dr
$$ (eq:moi-integral)

**Step 2: Uniform sphere** ($\rho = \text{const}$).

$$
C = \frac{8\pi}{3} \rho \int_0^R r^4 \, dr = \frac{8\pi}{3} \rho \frac{R^5}{5} = \frac{8\pi}{15} \rho R^5
$$

Using $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho$:

$$
\boxed{\frac{C}{MR^2} = \frac{8\pi\rho R^5 / 15}{(4\pi\rho R^3/3)\,R^2} = \frac{2}{5} = 0.400}
$$ (eq:moi-uniform)

**Step 3: Two-layer body** with a dense core (density $\rho_c$, radius $R_c$) and lighter mantle (density $\rho_m$, extending from $R_c$ to $R$):

$$
C = \frac{8\pi}{15} \left[ (\rho_c - \rho_m)\,R_c^5 + \rho_m\,R^5 \right]
$$

$$
M = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left[ (\rho_c - \rho_m)\,R_c^3 + \rho_m\,R^3 \right]
$$

Defining $x \equiv R_c/R$ and $f \equiv \rho_c/\rho_m$:

$$
\boxed{\frac{C}{MR^2} = \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{(f-1)\,x^5 + 1}{(f-1)\,x^3 + 1}}
$$ (eq:moi-two-layer)

When $f > 1$ (dense core), the factor multiplying $2/5$ is less than 1, because $x^5 < x^3$ for $0 < x < 1$. **The more mass concentrated toward the centre, the lower $C/MR^2$.**

**Worked example: Earth.** With $R_c/R \approx 3480/6371 \approx 0.546$ and $\rho_c/\rho_m \approx 11{,}000/4{,}400 \approx 2.5$:

$$
\frac{C}{MR^2} = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1.5 \times 0.049 + 1}{1.5 \times 0.163 + 1} = 0.4 \times \frac{1.073}{1.244} \approx 0.345
$$

The measured value is $C/MR^2 = 0.3307$ — close to our two-layer estimate, with the remaining difference due to the continuous density increase within each layer (especially the $\sim$30% density jump from outer to inner core).

**Key insight:** A single number — $C/MR^2$ — immediately distinguishes an undifferentiated rubble pile (0.4) from a strongly differentiated body like Earth (0.33). This is often the first constraint available for a newly characterised planet or moon.
```


## Equations of state

To construct a quantitative model of a planetary interior, we need an **equation of state** (EOS) that relates pressure $P$, density $\rho$, and temperature $T$ at every depth. The starting point is **hydrostatic equilibrium** — the condition that pressure at each depth supports the weight of the overlying material. In spherical symmetry {cite:p}`Turcotte2002`:

$$
\frac{dP}{dr} = -\rho(r)\,g(r) = -\frac{G\,m(r)\,\rho(r)}{r^2}
$$ (eq:hydrostatic-interior)

where $m(r) = 4\pi\int_0^r \rho(r')\,r'^2\,dr'$ is the mass enclosed within radius $r$ and $g(r) = Gm(r)/r^2$ is the local gravitational acceleration. This equation, combined with an EOS, can be integrated inward from the surface to determine the pressure, density, and composition at every depth.

For a rough estimate of the **central pressure** of a planet, we can assume uniform density $\bar{\rho} = 3M/(4\pi R^3)$:

$$
P_c \approx \frac{3\,G\,M^2}{8\pi\,R^4}
$$ (eq:central-pressure)

For Earth ($M = 5.97 \times 10^{24}$ kg, $R = 6371$ km), this gives $P_c \approx 170$ GPa — roughly half the actual value of $\sim$360 GPa, because the real density increases substantially toward the centre {cite:p}`Dziewonski1981`.

At the pressures and temperatures found in planetary interiors ($P \sim 1$–$10^4$ GPa, $T \sim 10^3$–$10^4$ K), material behaviour differs drastically from surface conditions. The **bulk modulus** $K = -V\,dP/dV = \rho\,dP/d\rho$ describes a material's resistance to compression. {cite:t}`Birch1952` established an empirical relationship between compressional wave velocity $v_P$ and density for silicates and oxides, known as **Birch's law**, which remains a cornerstone of mineral physics.

The **seismic parameter** $\phi \equiv K_S/\rho = v_P^2 - \frac{4}{3}v_S^2$ (where $K_S$ is the adiabatic bulk modulus) connects seismological observables directly to the EOS. The **Adams–Williamson equation** uses this to relate the density gradient to the seismic velocities:

$$
\frac{d\rho}{dr} = -\frac{\rho(r)\,g(r)}{\phi(r)}
$$

This equation allows seismologists to determine the density profile from measured wave speeds, provided the composition is approximately uniform within each layer and temperature effects are small.


## Earth's interior

Earth is the best-characterised planetary interior, thanks to thousands of seismometers recording earthquakes worldwide. The **Preliminary Reference Earth Model** (PREM; {cite:p}`Dziewonski1981`) synthesises travel-time data from millions of seismic arrivals into radial profiles of density, elastic moduli, and wave speeds. Earth's interior consists of four major layers:

The **Preliminary Reference Earth Model** (PREM) density profile as a function of radius. The density increases from $\sim$3300 kg m$^{-3}$ in the upper mantle to $\sim$5500 kg m$^{-3}$ at the base of the mantle, then jumps sharply at the core–mantle boundary (CMB, $\sim$3480 km radius) to $\sim$9900 kg m$^{-3}$ in the outer core. The inner core boundary at $\sim$1220 km radius marks another increase to $\sim$13{,}000 kg m$^{-3}$. The discontinuities at 410 and 660 km depth correspond to mineral phase transitions. Data from {cite:p}`Dziewonski1981`. Credit: Wikimedia Commons, public domain.
```

**The crust** is Earth's outermost solid layer, varying from $\sim$5–10 km thick beneath the oceans (dense basaltic rock, $\rho \approx 3000$ kg m$^{-3}$) to $\sim$30–70 km thick beneath the continents (lighter granitic rock, $\rho \approx 2700$ kg m$^{-3}$). Despite being the layer we inhabit and study most directly, the crust constitutes less than 1% of Earth's total mass.

**The mantle** extends from the base of the crust (the **Mohorovičić discontinuity**, or Moho) down to 2891 km depth. It is composed primarily of silicate minerals rich in magnesium and iron. Key seismic discontinuities divide it into:

- **Upper mantle** (to ~410 km): dominated by olivine ($\mathrm{(Mg,Fe)_2SiO_4}$), with densities of 3300–3700 kg m$^{-3}$
- **Transition zone** (410–660 km): olivine transforms to higher-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite, then ringwoodite; see [Phase transitions](phase-transitions-section) below)
- **Lower mantle** (660–2891 km): dominated by bridgmanite ($\mathrm{(Mg,Fe)SiO_3}$) and ferropericlase ($\mathrm{(Mg,Fe)O}$), with densities reaching $\sim$5500 kg m$^{-3}$ at the base

**The outer core** (2891–5150 km depth) is a liquid alloy of iron and nickel with $\sim$10% lighter elements (likely sulphur, oxygen, silicon, or hydrogen). Its liquid state is proven by the absence of S-waves and by the existence of Earth's magnetic dynamo ({ref}`lecture04`), which requires a convecting, electrically conducting fluid. Temperatures range from $\sim$4000 K at the top to $\sim$5000 K at the base.

**The inner core** (5150–6371 km depth) is solid iron–nickel, crystallised from the cooling outer core. Despite temperatures of $\sim$5000–6000 K, the enormous pressure ($\sim$330–360 GPa) keeps it solid. The inner core grows at an estimated rate of $\sim$0.5 mm yr$^{-1}$ as Earth slowly cools, and the latent heat released by this crystallisation is an important energy source for driving the geodynamo {cite:p}`Schubert2001`.


## Mantle rheology

Although Earth's mantle is **solid** (it transmits S-waves), it flows over geological timescales. This seemingly paradoxical behaviour arises because the mantle's **viscosity** — a measure of resistance to flow — is finite, around $10^{21}$ Pa·s for the upper mantle (compare $\sim$10$^{-3}$ Pa·s for water and $\sim$10$^{12}$ Pa·s for glacial ice). At temperatures above roughly half the melting point, solid-state **creep** mechanisms allow crystals to deform slowly by the diffusion of atoms along grain boundaries or through the crystal lattice {cite:p}`Karato2008`.

Whether the mantle convects vigorously is governed by the **Rayleigh number** (introduced in {ref}`lecture03`):

$$
\text{Ra} = \frac{\alpha\,\rho\,g\,\Delta T\,d^3}{\kappa\,\eta}
$$

where $\alpha$ is the thermal expansivity, $\Delta T$ the temperature difference driving convection, $d$ the layer thickness, $\kappa$ the thermal diffusivity, and $\eta$ the dynamic viscosity. For Earth's mantle, $\text{Ra} \sim 10^7$–$10^8$, far above the critical value $\text{Ra}_c \approx 10^3$ — so the mantle convects vigorously, driving plate tectonics at the surface ({ref}`lecture07`).

The pattern of mantle convection remains debated. **Whole-mantle convection** models have material circulating from the surface to the core–mantle boundary, while **layered convection** models propose that the 660 km discontinuity partially impedes flow, creating separate upper- and lower-mantle circulation cells. Seismic tomography — imaging the mantle's 3D velocity structure — reveals that some subducting slabs penetrate into the lower mantle while others stagnate near 660 km, suggesting a mixed regime {cite:p}`Schubert2001`.


(phase-transitions-section)=
## Phase transitions

As pressure and temperature increase with depth, minerals undergo **phase transitions** — rearrangements of their crystal structure to denser configurations. These transitions produce the seismic discontinuities that define the boundaries within Earth's mantle {cite:p}`Turcotte2002`:

| Depth (km) | Transition | Density change |
|:----------:|:---------:|:--------------:|
| 410 | Olivine → wadsleyite | $\sim$5% increase |
| 520 | Wadsleyite → ringwoodite | $\sim$2% increase |
| 660 | Ringwoodite → bridgmanite + ferropericlase | $\sim$8% increase |
| $\sim$2700 | Bridgmanite → post-perovskite | $\sim$1–2% increase |

The **410 km discontinuity** marks the transition of olivine ($\mathrm{(Mg,Fe)_2SiO_4}$) to wadsleyite, a denser crystal structure with the same chemical composition. At 660 km, the most dramatic transformation occurs: ringwoodite (the highest-pressure olivine polymorph) breaks down into bridgmanite ($\mathrm{(Mg,Fe)SiO_3}$, a perovskite-structured phase) plus ferropericlase ($\mathrm{(Mg,Fe)O}$). This **660 km discontinuity** is the most important internal boundary within the mantle, marking the transition from upper to lower mantle. Its negative Clapeyron slope (the boundary pressure decreases with increasing temperature) means it partially resists the passage of convecting material, influencing the style of mantle convection.

Near the base of the mantle ($\sim$2700 km depth), bridgmanite transforms to **post-perovskite** — a phase discovered in laboratory experiments in 2004. This transition may explain the seismically anomalous **D" layer** just above the core–mantle boundary, where seismic velocities show complex lateral variations.

These phase transitions are not unique to Earth. Any sufficiently large rocky body will experience them at appropriate pressures, though the specific depths depend on the body's size, gravity, and thermal state. Mars, for example, likely has an olivine-to-wadsleyite transition in its deep mantle, while the Moon is too small to reach the required pressures.


## Comparative terrestrial interiors

While Earth's interior is uniquely well characterised, we can apply the same principles to other terrestrial bodies. The combination of mean density, $C/MR^2$, and (where available) seismic data constrains their internal structures {cite:p}`dePaterLissauer2010`.

The thin crust and silicate mantle surround a large liquid iron–sulphur core (bright centre) with radius $\sim$1830 km — approximately 54% of Mars's radius. The core is proportionally larger but less dense than Earth's, indicating a higher fraction of light elements. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech (PIA16078).
```

**The Moon** ($C/MR^2 = 0.393$, $\bar{\rho} = 3346$ kg m$^{-3}$) is only weakly differentiated. Apollo seismometers (1969–1977) revealed a crust $\sim$30–40 km thick, a silicate mantle extending to $\sim$1400 km depth, and a small partially molten core with radius $\sim$330–380 km (only $\sim$20% of the Moon's radius). The near-undifferentiated state ($C/MR^2$ close to 0.4) and low mean density are consistent with a body that formed primarily from silicate mantle material — supporting the giant impact hypothesis for the Moon's origin ({ref}`lecture02`).

**Mars** ($C/MR^2 = 0.364$, $\bar{\rho} = 3934$ kg m$^{-3}$) was transformed from a one-data-point problem into a seismically characterised planet by NASA's **InSight mission** (2018–2022). The SEIS seismometer detected hundreds of marsquakes, revealing {cite:p}`Khan2021,Stahler2021`:

- A **crust** 24–72 km thick (varying between the thin northern lowlands and thick southern highlands)
- A **mantle** extending to $\sim$1560 km depth, with an olivine-to-wadsleyite transition at $\sim$1100 km
- A **liquid core** of radius $\sim$1830 km ($\sim$54% of Mars's radius), composed of iron alloyed with sulphur and other light elements

Mars's core is proportionally larger than Earth's (54% vs 55% by radius), but less dense ($\sim$6000 kg m$^{-3}$ vs $\sim$10{,}900 kg m$^{-3}$), indicating a higher fraction of light elements — particularly sulphur. The absence of a present-day global magnetic field suggests the core is no longer convecting vigorously enough to sustain a dynamo, although remnant crustal magnetisation records an ancient field ({ref}`lecture04`).

**Mercury** ($C/MR^2 = 0.346$, $\bar{\rho} = 5427$ kg m$^{-3}$) presents a puzzle: it has the highest uncompressed density of any terrestrial planet, implying a very large iron core. MESSENGER spacecraft data, combined with Earth-based radar observations of Mercury's forced libration, constrain the core radius to $\sim$2020 km — approximately **85% of the planet's radius** and containing $\sim$65% of its mass. A thin silicate mantle ($\sim$400 km) and crust ($\sim$30–50 km) overlie this enormous core. Mercury retains a weak but global magnetic field, indicating that at least part of its core is still liquid and convecting. Explaining why Mercury has such a large core fraction remains an active area of research (forward ref {ref}`lecture10`).


## Giant planet interiors

Jupiter and Saturn are fundamentally different from rocky planets: composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, they lack distinct solid surfaces. Their "surfaces" are conventionally defined as the 1-bar pressure level, and below this the atmosphere transitions continuously into an increasingly dense interior {cite:p}`FortneyNettelmann2010`.

```{figure} figures/jupiter_interior.jpg

:align: center

Jupiter's internal structure shown as a radial cross-section (with Earth for scale at lower right). The outermost layer is convecting molecular $\mathrm{H_2}$. Below, a helium rain layer forms a stably stratified region where helium droplets settle inward. Deeper still, metallic hydrogen convects vigorously, generating Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. The core region (bottom) shows a gradual increase in heavy-element concentration — the **dilute core** inferred from Juno gravity data {cite:p}`Wahl2017`. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech (PIA25062).
```

**Jupiter** ($M = 318\,\Mearth$, $R = 11.2\,\Rearth$) has been characterised with unprecedented precision by the **Juno mission** (2016–present), which measures Jupiter's gravity field to high accuracy. The interior can be described in broad terms:

- **Molecular hydrogen envelope** (outer ~15% by radius): $\mathrm{H_2}$ gas transitioning to liquid, $\rho \sim 0.2$–$1$ g cm$^{-3}$
- **Metallic hydrogen layer** (extending to ~80% of the radius): at pressures above $\sim$1–4 Mbar ($10^{11}$–$4 \times 10^{11}$ Pa), hydrogen undergoes a gradual transition to a **metallic state** where electrons are delocalised and the material conducts electricity. This conducting metallic hydrogen is the source of Jupiter's powerful magnetic field ({ref}`lecture04`)
- **Core region**: Juno's gravity data show that heavy elements (rock and ice) are not concentrated in a small compact core but are instead spread over a large **dilute core** extending to perhaps 30–50% of Jupiter's radius {cite:p}`Wahl2017`. This may be a relic of the formation process or the result of erosion of an initially compact core by convective mixing

Central conditions reach approximately 4000 GPa and 20{,}000 K. Jupiter radiates roughly 1.7 times the energy it receives from the Sun, indicating substantial internal heat production from ongoing gravitational contraction (the **Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism**).

**Saturn** ($M = 95\,\Mearth$, $R = 9.4\,\Rearth$) shares Jupiter's overall structure but with some key differences. Saturn's lower mass means pressures are lower throughout, so the metallic hydrogen transition occurs deeper. Saturn also has a larger proportional heavy-element enrichment. A notable process in Saturn's interior is **helium rain**: as the planet cools, helium becomes immiscible in metallic hydrogen and forms droplets that settle toward the centre, releasing gravitational energy and explaining Saturn's unexpectedly high heat output. Saturn radiates about 2.0 times the absorbed solar flux — more than expected from simple contraction alone.


## Ice giant interiors

Uranus ($M = 14.5\,\Mearth$) and Neptune ($M = 17.1\,\Mearth$) are often called **ice giants** to distinguish them from the gas giants, because a large fraction of their mass consists of heavier molecules — primarily water ($\mathrm{H_2O}$), ammonia ($\mathrm{NH_3}$), and methane ($\mathrm{CH_4}$) — rather than hydrogen and helium {cite:p}`FortneyNettelmann2010`.

The canonical three-layer model consists of:

1. **Hydrogen–helium envelope** (outermost $\sim$20% by mass): molecular gas transitioning to denser fluid
2. **Ice/fluid layer** ($\sim$60–70% by mass): a hot, dense fluid of water, ammonia, and methane at pressures of $\sim$10–500 GPa and temperatures of $\sim$2000–7000 K. Despite the name "ice," this material is actually a **superionic fluid** — a state where oxygen atoms form a crystalline lattice while hydrogen atoms diffuse freely, conducting electricity like a metal
3. **Rocky core** ($\sim$10–20% by mass): silicates and iron at the centre, though the boundary with the ice layer may be gradational

The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strikingly unusual: both are strongly **tilted** relative to the rotation axis (59° for Uranus, 47° for Neptune) and **offset** from the planet's centre. This contrasts sharply with the roughly dipolar, axially aligned fields of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. The explanation likely involves the geometry of the conducting region: rather than being generated in a deep metallic hydrogen shell (as in Jupiter), the ice giant dynamos may operate in the shallow, thin conducting ice layer, producing more complex field geometries.

Neptune emits $\sim$2.6 times the solar energy it absorbs, while Uranus has essentially **no measurable internal heat excess** — a long-standing puzzle. Proposed explanations include compositional gradients that inhibit convection in Uranus's interior, trapping heat within, while Neptune convects more freely. This remains one of the key open questions motivating future ice giant missions (forward ref {ref}`lecture11`).


## Icy moon interiors

Among the most remarkable discoveries in planetary science is that several moons in the outer solar system harbour **subsurface liquid water oceans** beneath their icy shells. These ocean worlds are prime targets for astrobiology because they provide the three key ingredients for life: liquid water, chemical energy, and organic molecules ({ref}`lecture07`; forward ref {ref}`lecture14`) {cite:p}`NimmoPappalardo2016`.

```

**Europa** ($R = 1561$ km, $\rho = 3013$ kg m$^{-3}$) has an ice shell estimated at $\sim$15–25 km thick overlying a global ocean $\sim$60–150 km deep — containing roughly 2–3 times the volume of Earth's oceans. The evidence comes from multiple sources: magnetic induction measurements by the Galileo spacecraft (a time-varying magnetic field induced by Jupiter's rotating magnetosphere, requiring a near-surface conducting layer), surface geology (disrupted ice blocks in **chaos terrain** that resemble terrestrial sea ice), and gravity data. Tidal heating from Europa's orbital eccentricity (maintained by the Laplace resonance with Io and Ganymede) provides the energy to keep the ocean liquid {cite:p}`Hussmann2006`. The upcoming **Europa Clipper** mission (launched 2024) will characterise Europa's ice shell and ocean in unprecedented detail.

**Enceladus** ($R = 252$ km, $\rho = 1609$ kg m$^{-3}$) provides the most direct evidence for a subsurface ocean: the Cassini spacecraft flew through **geysers** of water vapour and ice particles erupting from four fractures (the "tiger stripes") near the south pole {cite:p}`Porco2006` (see also {ref}`lecture07`). Analysis of the plume material revealed salts, silica nanoparticles (indicating hydrothermal activity on the seafloor at >90°C), and molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H_2}$) — a potential energy source for chemosynthetic life. Enceladus's subsurface ocean is global (determined from libration measurements) despite the moon's small size, maintained liquid by tidal heating from its orbital resonance with Dione {cite:p}`Howett2011`.

**Titan** ($R = 2575$ km, $\rho = 1882$ kg m$^{-3}$) likely harbours a subsurface water–ammonia ocean beneath a thick ice shell ($\sim$50–100 km). Evidence comes from Cassini radar measurements of Titan's rotation rate, which revealed a slight non-synchronous component consistent with a decoupled ice shell floating on a liquid layer. Titan's low density suggests a roughly 50:50 rock–ice composition, with a rocky core, ice mantle, and the ammonia-bearing ocean at depth. The Dragonfly rotorcraft mission, scheduled to arrive at Titan in the 2030s, will explore its surface chemistry and prebiotic conditions.

The existence of these ocean worlds demonstrates that the classical **habitable zone** — defined by the distance from a star where liquid water can exist on a surface — is far too narrow a concept. Tidal heating, radiogenic heating ({ref}`lecture03`), and insulating ice shells can maintain liquid water far beyond the snow line, vastly expanding the potential environments for life in the universe.


## Recent advances

NASA's InSight mission (2018–2022) delivered landmark results for Mars interior science. Seismology from the SEIS instrument detected marsquakes and measured seismic wave travel times through the planet, revealing a liquid iron-alloy core with radius $\sim$1830 km {cite:p}`Stahler2021`, a mantle with a thick lithosphere ($\sim$500 km) and a transition zone at $\sim$1100 km depth {cite:p}`Khan2021`, and a crust averaging 25–45 km in thickness. These measurements provided the first seismological constraints on another planet's interior since Apollo, confirming that Mars is differentiated but has a proportionally larger core and thinner crust than Earth's two-layer models would predict ({ref}`lecture07`).

For giant planets, Juno's precise gravity measurements have strengthened the case for a **dilute core** in Jupiter — rather than a compact rocky/icy core, Jupiter's heavy elements appear to be distributed over the inner $\sim$30–50% of the planet's radius, gradually mixing into the metallic hydrogen envelope {cite:p}`Wahl2017`. This result challenges the traditional core accretion picture in which the core remains distinct, and has motivated new models of core erosion and primordial mixing during giant planet formation ({ref}`lecture02`).

NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launched in 2024, will make dozens of close flybys of Europa to characterise its ice shell thickness, ocean salinity, and surface geology {cite:p}`HowellPappalardo2020`. Ice-penetrating radar, gravity measurements, and magnetometry will provide the most detailed constraints yet on the internal structure of an ocean world — directly testing models of subsurface ocean circulation and habitability ({ref}`lecture14`).
