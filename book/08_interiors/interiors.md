# Lecture 8: Planetary Interiors — Structure, Composition, & Dynamics

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to explain how we probe planetary interiors, apply equations of state at planetary conditions, and compare the internal structures of terrestrial planets, giant planets, and icy moons.
```

## Probing interiors

Seismology, gravity field, and moment of inertia.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Equations of state

Relating pressure, density, and temperature at depth.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Earth's interior

Crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Mantle rheology

Viscous flow and mantle convection patterns.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Phase transitions

Olivine–spinel–perovskite and post-perovskite.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Comparative interiors

Moon (small core), Mars (large core fraction), Mercury (large iron core).

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Giant planet interiors

Metallic hydrogen, layered vs. dilute cores.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Ice giant interiors

Water, ammonia, and methane ices under extreme pressures.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Icy moon interiors

Subsurface oceans: Europa, Enceladus, and Titan.
