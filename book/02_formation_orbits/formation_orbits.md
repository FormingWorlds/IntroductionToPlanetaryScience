# Lecture 2: Planet Formation 101 & Orbital Dynamics

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to describe the stages of planet formation from protoplanetary disks, apply Kepler's laws and the vis-viva equation, and explain the role of orbital resonances, tides, and migration in shaping planetary systems.
