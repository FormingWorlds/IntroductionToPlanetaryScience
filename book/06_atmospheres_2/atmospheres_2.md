# Lecture 6: Atmospheres II — Clouds, Weather, & Climate

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to explain cloud formation across the solar system, describe atmospheric circulation patterns, and discuss long-term climate evolution including feedbacks and the faint young Sun problem.
