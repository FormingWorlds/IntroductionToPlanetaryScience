# Lecture 7: Planetary Surfaces — Geology, Geomorphology, & Geophysics

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to describe the major surface processes shaping planetary bodies, apply crater counting to estimate surface ages, and compare tectonic and volcanic styles across the solar system.
```

## Surface processes

Impact cratering, volcanism, tectonics, and erosion.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Impact cratering

Mechanics, morphology (simple, complex, basins), crater counting and surface ages.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Volcanism

Effusive vs. explosive, volcanic landforms across the solar system.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Tectonics

Plate tectonics on Earth, stagnant lid on other terrestrial bodies.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Erosion and weathering

Aeolian, fluvial, glacial, and chemical processes.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Remote sensing of surfaces

Spectroscopy, radar, and altimetry.

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Regolith formation and space weathering

```{note}
This section is under development.
```

## Cryovolcanism on icy bodies

Enceladus, Triton, and Europa.
