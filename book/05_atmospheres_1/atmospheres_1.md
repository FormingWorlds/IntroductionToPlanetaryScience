# Lecture 5: Atmospheres I — Composition, Structure, & Dynamics

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to classify atmospheric types, derive pressure–temperature profiles from hydrostatic equilibrium, explain the greenhouse effect and energy balance, and evaluate atmospheric escape mechanisms.
