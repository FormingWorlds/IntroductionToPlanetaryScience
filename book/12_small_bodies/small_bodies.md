# Lecture 12: Meteorites, Asteroids, Minor Planets & Comets

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to classify meteorites and explain what they reveal about early solar system conditions, describe the structure of the asteroid belt and Kuiper Belt, and characterise comet composition and activity.
```

## Meteorite classification

Chondrites (ordinary, carbonaceous, enstatite), achondrites, irons, and stony-irons.

## Isotopic dating

Pb–Pb, Al–Mg, and Hf–W chronometry.
