# Lecture 11: Gas & Ice Giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to compare the internal structures and atmospheric dynamics of the four giant planets, describe the diversity of their satellite systems, and explain ring system dynamics.
```

## Jupiter

Composition, internal structure, and atmospheric dynamics.
