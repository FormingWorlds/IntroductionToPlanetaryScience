# Lecture 14: Synthesis — Solar System in Context & Astrobiology

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to place our solar system in the context of observed exoplanet diversity, evaluate habitability as a systems-level property, and identify key open questions and future directions in planetary science.
