# Lecture 10: Rocky Planets — Mercury & Mars

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to explain Mercury's unusual spin–orbit resonance and large iron core, reconstruct the geological history of Mars, and assess the evidence for past and present water on Mars.
