# Lecture 9: Rocky Planets — Earth & Venus

```{highlights}
**Learning objectives:** By the end of this lecture, you will be able to describe Earth's unique properties as a reference planet, explain how Venus diverged from Earth despite similar bulk properties, and evaluate the runaway greenhouse mechanism and its implications.
